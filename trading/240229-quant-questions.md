> 1. Nine months call options with strikes 20 and 25 on a non-dividend-paying underlying asset with spot price $22 are trading for $5.5 and $1, respectively. Can you find an arbitrage?

Note that a call option with strike 0 on a non-dividend-paying underlying asset is the same as one unit of the asset, since the call with strike 0 will always be exercised at maturity by paying $0, i.e., the strike of the option, to receive one unit of the asset. Thus, we are implicitly given a third call option with strike K = 0 and price $22 (i.e., the spot price of the asset), and we can proceed to identify whether there is convexity arbitrage for these three call options.

Let $$K_{1}=0, K_{2}=20, K_{3}=25$$
